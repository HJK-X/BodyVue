Control of all devices through pins via built in gpiozero library:

  Raspberry Pi:
documentation - https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html

  Camera Control:
monitor to manually focus - raspistill -t 0 (adjustment screws to lock in)

  Servo Control:
datasheet - https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/16-channel-pwm-servo-driver.pdf
built in servo library - from gpiozero import Servo
hardware based timing for PWIM and servo pulses - from gpiozero.pins.pigpio import PiGPIOFactory (obtain min and max pulse time in ms from servo data sheet)
sweeping motions - servo.value = math.radians(x) where x == positions

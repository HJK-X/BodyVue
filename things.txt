Control of all devices through pins via built in gpiozero library:

  Camera Control:
monitor to manually focus - raspistill -t 0 (adjustment screws to lock in)

  Servo Control:
built in servo library - from gpiozero import Servo
hardware based timing for PWIM and servo pulses - from gpiozero.pins.pigpio import PiGPIOFactory (obtain min and max pulse time in ms from servo data sheet)
sweeping motions - servo.value = math.radians(x) where x == positions
